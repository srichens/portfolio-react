## Bootcamp Week 20 Challenge

This week's challenge was to create a single-page application portfolio using React. The requirements included the following:

1. Portfolio contains a header, content section, and footer.
2. The header includes a profile picture and navigation links to About Me, Portfolio, Contact and Resume that take you to each section without reloading the page.
3. The Portfolio section includes links to six projects and their Github repos.
4. The Contact section has a form to enter name, email, and a message; each field is required and validated by an error message.
5. The Resume page includes a link to a downloadable resume.
6. The footer includes links to Github, LinkedIn, and another site like Stack Overflow.

## Process Highlights

1. This was a pretty fun project. I ended up spending some time creating a home page that I didn't include in the deployed app, since it didn't fit into the requirements, but I left the code in, commented out. It gave me more practice at responsiveness, if nothing else.
2. I used plain CSS rather than Bootstrap, so that I could practice for the final project, so making sure everything was responsive took a while.
3. It took me a while to get the title links to be highlighted when on each page. I used :target and IDs to correspond to the href, but that seemed like a workaround. Maybe if I had used Bootstrap there would've been an easier way. I tried to do it with useState, but I couldn't figure that out. Also, I then couldn't figure out how to get the About Me title to be highlighted when the app is first opened. Probably should have spend less time on the home page that I didn't include and wasn't required.
